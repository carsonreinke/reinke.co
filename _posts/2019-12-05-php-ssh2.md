If you are having a problem with PHP segfaulting when using the PHP SSH2 extension, I will able to solve this issue by removing the system installed extension and using PECL to install it via source.  There is problably is some sort of mismatch in the packaging between `php-ssh2` and the dependency `libssh2-1`.

Below is how I was able to fix it (all with `sudo`):
* `apt remove php-ssh2`
* `apt install libssh2-1-dev`
* `vim /usr/share/php/Archive/Tar.php` remove `&` from line 639 (see <https://www.dotkernel.com/php-troubleshooting/fix-installing-pear-packages-with-php-7-2/>)
* `pecl install ssh2-1.1.2`
* `pear install Archive_Tar`
* `phpenmod ssh2`
