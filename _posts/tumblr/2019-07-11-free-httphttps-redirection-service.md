[Free HTTP/HTTPS Redirection Service](https://redirector.website)  

I built this! It was quite rewarding to take a concept (even if tons of similar tools exist) from idea to implementation to deployment. It was definitely a great learning oppurtunity into some of the following:

- Nginx modules
- Unit testing in C
- Debugging in C
- Integration testing in Nginx
- DNS mocking
- Ansible
- GitHub pages
