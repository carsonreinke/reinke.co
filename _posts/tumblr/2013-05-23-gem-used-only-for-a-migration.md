Figured out how to do this, mostly by the insight [here](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/13783801/composing-one-gemfile-from-multiple-others). &nbsp;Added a Gemfile just for the migration, included the projectâ€™s Gemfile with&nbsp;`instance_eval(File.read(File.join(File.dirname( __FILE__ ), '..', '..', 'Gemfile')))`. &nbsp;When running the migration, just added in environment variable&nbsp;`BUNDLE_GEMFILE` to use that migration specific Gemfile.
